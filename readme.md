# LaTeX Kochbuch
Private collection of cooking recipes

## Getting started
This is a collection of single recipes formated with LaTeX and tight together into a single cookbook by the central *kochbuch.tex* file.

### Prerequisites
In order to compile the cookbook you will need a working LaTeX installation, see https://www.latex-project.org/get/ to find a suitable solution for you.

### Compilation
Run *kochbuch.tex* throug f.i. *pdflatex* at least twice like this:
```
pdflatex kochbuch.tex
pdflatex kochbuch.tex
```
This should create a file called *kockbuch.pdf*
